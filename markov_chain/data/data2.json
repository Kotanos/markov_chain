Even Bjorn has been behaving like an idiot, hurting Torvi, as if she hasn't yet been through enough in life. In real life I believe everybody would call that a prick. I used to really like the child Bjorn but care very little, if nothing, for the adult one. Who cares about his dumb random trips to the Mediterranean, boring. If I were Ivar I would feel contemptuous towards all of them too. His rage is justified, because he is surrounded by incapable betraying idiots.",

I like Ivar being crippled, it makes his character more interesting and relatable. I do think Ivar will do amazing things in the show, but I also think that we will potentially see the beginning of Christian dominance in Scandinavia, most likely via Alfred, Headmund and Rollo.

His second wife was Aslaug, although she initially went by the name Kr√°ka. I'm not sure why you're suddenly getting upset with the show, it was nothing like Ragnar's saga from the beginning. Hirst clearly wants to tell his own story with characters loosely based off of characters from the sagas and real historical vikings. I have no problem with that and I disagree with you about his talent at developing characters, I think Vikings has some of the best character development I've ever seen in a show. One thing I will say is that it's a shame that there are very few movies and tv shows that are actually accurate to Scandinavian history and to the sagas and I hope that people don't watch Vikings and think that it's accurately representing how things went down in the real history and in the sagas. I appreciate your passion for Scandinavian sagas and history though, I share that passion. Have a good day",

He's had to watch as his brothers become great warriors, sleep with women and inherit the reputation and responsibilities of the great Ragnar Lothbrok, whilst he's laughed at and underestimated. As for Aslaug, I think she felt understandably neglected and mistreated by Ragnar and that turned her into a very bitter person, but I honestly think she gets it worse than she deserves from the fans and if she is a witch, so what? I agree that Ivar shouldn't have killed Sigurd, but the anger issues that he has developed are understandable. All that said, I think Ubbe is my favorite of Ragnar's sons. Just some thoughts",

He is consistently being clever strategically and among men, but manipulated like a pussy, by a girl.. Killed his own brother (the one he tried to kill 2 times before), disregarded his older AND wiser ones.. Ivar's rage is not justified, it's a justification for being a cripple, incapable of having sex or fighting like other Vikings. Ubbe is the smartest of them all, all it took him to become the closest thing to his father, is living through bad decisions and defeats. Ragnar said that one learns from defeats. If you're right one time, that doesn't make you right in the future. This is where Ivar failed his father the most (apart from tearing his family apart) - in contrast with Ubbe, who always had the big picture in perspective, but made some bad calls early in his leadership days, which will make him a force to be reckoned with in the future of the show, i'm sure.",

Since Ragnar was avenged there hasn‚Äôt really been a villain so it seems like Ivar has taken up that mantel. As for Harold, I like that he was deceived by Ubbe, I think it worked to establish Ubbe‚Äôs cleverness and Ragnar-esque trickster skills. Hvitserk is really coming into his own, Lagertha‚Äôs story is clearly coming to an end in an interesting way, Bjorn‚Äôs been set on a trajectory towards Ivar in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel contrived and Harold is his natural ally in his war against Ivar, especially in the wake of his defeat against Alfred. As for Alfred and Ubbe, I love their relationship and I‚Äôm excited about the future of their story. I will say, I‚Äôm not sure I liked the killing of √Üthelred, I would have liked to see him make amends for his disloyalty and fight alongside Ubbe and Alfred against the Danish Vikings. I‚Äôm not sure about Floki‚Äôs story, we‚Äôll see what happens",
